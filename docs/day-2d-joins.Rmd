# Types of joins

To work with relational data you need join operations that work with pairs of tables.  There are two families of verbs designed to work with relational data:

.pull-left[

* __Mutating joins__: add new variables to one data frame by matching observations in another.

* __Filter joins__:  filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

.pull-right[

```{r dplyr-hex, echo=FALSE, out.height="60%", out.width="60%"}

# Prerequisites

### Packages

```{r pkgs}
library(tidyverse) # or library(dplyr)

### Example data

```{r join-setup}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3"

- __keys__ are variables that connect pairs of tables
- A primary key uniquely identifies an observation in its own table

# Your Turn!

.pull-left[

### Challenge

1. Join the transactions and products data using `inner_join()`. The join key is the `product_num` variable.

2. Join the transactions, products, and households data using two `inner_join()`s. The join key between transactions and products is the `product_num` variable and the join key between transactions and housholds is the `hshd_num` variable.

]

.pull-right[

### Solution

.code70[

```{r your-turn-1}
# 1
trans_prod <- transactions %>% inner_join(products, by = "product_num")

# 2
combined <- transactions %>% 
  inner_join(products, by = "product_num") %>%
  inner_join(households, by = "hshd_num")

head(combined)

<br>
.font120[

* Filtering joins affect the observations rather than adding variables

* Use when wanting to filter one data set based on foreign key variables in another data set

* There are 2 types of filtering joins:

   - .bold.font120[`anti_join()`]

### Steps:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
households %>%
  filter(______) %>%               # filter for hshd_num 3708
  inner_join(______) %>%           # inner join w/transactions
  inner_join(______) %>%           # inner join w/products
  group_by(______) %>%             # group by commodity
  summarize(total = ______) %>%    # compute total spend
  ggplot(aes(______, ______)) +    # plot total spend vs. commodity
  geom_point()
