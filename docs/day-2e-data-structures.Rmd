# Getting exposure

<br>

.pull-left[

* This section is meant to give you exposure to the main data structures used in R

* As you become more familiar with R you will, inevitably, become more familiar with most of these structures

* However, you will not be required to apply the methods you see in this afternoon's case study

.font300.bold[Atomic Vectors]

---
# Properties

.pull-left[

* .blue[1 dimension]

* Only holds .blue[homogenous] data types

* If you try to combine non-homogeneous types, .blue[coercion] occurs
   - Non-characters become characters
   - Logicals become numerics
   - Factors are funky
]

.pull-right[

```{r atomic-vector-examples}
letters

1:12

sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 10, replace = TRUE)

# Coercion --------------------------------------------------------
# Non-characters become characters
c("a", "b", 1:2)

# Logicals become numerics
c(1:2, TRUE)

# Factors are funky
c(factor("a"), 1)
c(factor("a"), "b")
```

]

---

# Application

.scrollable90[
.pull-left[

* Vectors are the fundamental building block for all other data types

* You will use them on a daily basis
   - For filtering
   - For naming columns
   - Creating factor levels
   - Holding values for comparison
   - ...
]   

.pull-right[

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r vector-application}
# for filtering
dplyr::filter(warpbreaks, tension %in% c("L", "H")) %>% as_tibble()

# Indexing

We can access specific elements of a vector with brackets:


.center.blue[`vector[element]`]

.code70[

```{r}
# some vector
v <- letters[1:10]
v
```

]

--

.code70[

```{r}
# index by element number
v[1]
v[c(1, 5, 10)]
v[-c(1, 5, 10)]
```

]

--

.code70[

```{r}

# if the vector is named we can index by name
names(v) <- LETTERS[1:10]
v

v[c("A", "A", "B")]
```

]

class: clear, center, middle

.font300.bold[Matrices]

---

# Properties

.pull-left[

* .blue[2 dimensions]
   - rows
   - columns

* Can only contain .blue[homogenous] data

* All rows & columns must be of equal length

]

.pull-right[

```{r matrix-example}
# numeric matrix
set.seed(123)
v1 <- sample(1:10, 25, replace = TRUE)
m1 <- matrix(v1, nrow = 5)
m1

# character matrix
m2 <- matrix(letters[1:9], nrow = 3)
m2
```

]

---

# Application

.pull-left[

* Matrix algebra

* I use them rarely accept when a certain result is provided in matrix form (i.e. correlation matrices)

]

.pull-right[

```{r matrix-application}
# correlation matrix
cor(mtcars)[, 1:5]

# matrix multiplication
m3 <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2)
m4 <- matrix(6:11, ncol = 2)
m3 %*% m4
```


]

---

# Indexing

We can access specific elements of a matrix with brackets:

.center.blue[`matrix[row, col]`]

```{r}
m5 <- matrix(1:15, nrow = 3)

# first element, third colum
m5[1, 3]
```

--

```{r}
# first three elements of all columns
m5[1:2, ]
```

--

```{r}
# Using names to access rows and columns
colnames(m5) <- letters[1:5]
rownames(m5) <- LETTERS[1:3]
m5[c("A", "C"), c("b", "d")]
```

---
class: clear, center, middle

.font300.bold[Arrays]

---
# Properties

.pull-left[

* Similar to a matrix but...

* has .blue[3 dimensions]
   - rows
   - columns
   - depth

* An array with depth = 1 is the same as a matrix

]

.pull-right[

```{r array-example}
# depth = 2
array(1:25, c(3, 5, 2))

# depth = 1 (same as a matrix)
array(1:15, c(3, 5, 1))
```

]

---

# Application

<br>

* Generally arrays are used sparingly unless you get into deep learning modeling with __Keras__ and __TensorFlow__.  There are a few machine learning packages that provide arrays as outputs (i.e. __glmnet__) but that is the exception rather than the rule.

* For now, you should not be too concerned about mastering this data structure

---

# Indexing

We can access specific elements of an array with brackets:

.center.blue[`array[row, col, depth]`]

```{r}
a1 <- array(1:25, c(3, 5, 2))

# rows 1 & 2, columns 2-4 of the second matrix
a1[1:2, 2:4, 2]
```

--

```{r}
# first row and all columns of both matrices (converts result into a single matrix)
a1[1, , ]
```

---
class: clear, center, middle

.font300.bold[Data Frames]

---

# Properties

.pull-left[


* Most common data structure you'll work with

* .blue[Spreadsheet style] data

* .blue[2 dimensions]
   - rows
   - columns

* Can contain .blue[heterogenous data]

* All columns must be of equal length

* A .blue[tibble] is just a .blue[slightly modified data frame]

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
completejourney::transactions_sample
```

]

---

# Application

<br>

* holding imported data

* exploratory data analysis

---

# Indexing

We can access specific elements of a data frame with brackets...

.center.blue[`data.frame[row, col]`]

...but most of your indexing during EDA will likely be done with __dplyr__ functions.


```{r}
# first 10 rows for 3 columns
mpg[1:10, c("manufacturer", "model", "cty")]

```


---

# Indexing

For data frames, we can actually extract a single column 3 different ways:

* preserve: `data.frame[column]`
* simplify: `data.frame[[column]]`
* simplify: `data.frame$column`

.pull-left-30[

```{r}
# preserve output as data frame
mpg["cty"]
```

]
--
.pull-left-30[

```{r}
# simplify output as a vector
mpg[["cty"]]
```

]
--
.pull-left-30[

```{r}
# simplify output as a vector
mpg$cty
```

]

---
class: clear, center, middle

.font300.bold[Lists]

---

# Properties

.pull-left[

* .blue[1 dimension]

* Acts like a vector (technically it is a vector) but where .blue[each element can hold any other data structure] (i.e. vectors, data frames, matrices, and even lists)

* Can only contain .blue[heterogeneous data]

* Think of it like a shopping cart that just holds a bunch of other structures

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
l1 <- list(item1 = v1, item2 = m1, item3 = mpg)
l1
```


]

---

# Application

<br>

* Many statistical modeling results come in the form of lists

* You need to know how to extract parts of a list to access model results

* As you start using R more, and possible start creating your own classes, you will use lists to hold different information

---

# Indexing

Like data frames, we can extract a single list item 3 different ways:

* preserve: `list[column]`
* simplify: `list[[column]]`
* simplify: `list$column`

.pull-left-30[

```{r}
# preserve output as a list
a <- l1["item1"]

is.list(a)
is.atomic(a)

a
```

]
--
.pull-left-30[

```{r}
# simplify output as a vector
b <- l1[["item1"]]

is.list(b)
is.atomic(b)

b
```

]
--
.pull-left-30[

```{r}
# simplify output as a vector
c <- l1$item1

is.list(c)
is.atomic(c)

c
```

]

---

# Indexing

With lists, we often combine previous indexing procedures to extract information.

.pull-left[

```{r}
# a linear model
model <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars)

# results are in a list
str(model)
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r}
# get the first ten residuals
model[["residuals"]][1:10]

# get the coefficient for the wt variable
model$coefficients["wt"]
```

]

---

# Take away

* Get familiar with vectors and data frames / tibbles as quickly as possible

* Then start getting familiar with lists

* Learn matrices and arrays as you see fit

* Get familiar with using brackets `[` and `$` for indexing elements/components
